Welcome to my first 5 pages Web HTML pages!
=================
This is the assignment 1 for U Pitt Information science web standard and technologies. 
The whole file contains 5 hand coded, responsive (looks good both on mobile devices and web pages) with simple bootstrap style and javascript  pages. I am so glad that you happened to click on and would like to check out the online flower shop! Assignment contains many online picures, icons, and articles, I referenced them in the code in comment.
