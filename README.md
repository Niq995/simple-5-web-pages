Welcome to my first 5 pages Web HTML pages!
=================
This is the assignment 1 for U Pitt Information science web standard and technologies. The whole file contains 5 hand coded not responsive and tedious (of course, for a new web desiner:) pages. I am so glad that you happened to click on and would like to check out the online flower shop! Assignment contains many online picures and icons, I referenced them in the code in comment.
