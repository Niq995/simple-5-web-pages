        <h1>
          3 best Valentine's Day flowers anyone would love to receive
        </h1>
        <p class="article1">
          Who doesn’t love receiving flowers? We’ve found a whole range of
          striking bouquets that are perfect for making your special someone
          feel adored come Valentine’s Day. Rest assured, every bunch listed
          here has passed our stringent quality checks. Some brands are
          established favourites that we’ve been buying from personally for
          years. Those we hadn’t come across before sent across a bouquet so we
          could confirm what their blooms look and smell like upon arrival, how
          they’re packaged, how long they last and whether or not they live up
          to the photo. We’ve included options to suit all budgets, from
          bargains that look much more expensive than they are to luxury treats
          your partner will be showing off on Instagram. We’ve included a few
          “outside the box” alternatives to the classic fresh flower bouquet,
          too.
        </p>
        <p class="article1">
          Every bunch is available to order online for UK nationwide delivery,
          sometimes the next day, and you can add a personal gift message before
          paying. These flowers and houseplants would also make fabulous gifts
          for anyone with a February birthday, or someone who simply needs a
          little pick-me-up. We’ve included the time and date you need to order
          by to guarantee delivery on Valentine’s Day, so you have no excuse not
          to make your favourite person’s day! You can trust our independent
          reviews. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we
          never allow this to influence selections, which are formed from
          real-world testing and expert advice. This revenue helps to fund
          journalism across The Independent.
